# KSail - Adult sailing courses

KSail is a microsite focused on adult sailing courses.
It is broadly designed around an exisiting page on the Royal St. George Yacht Club.
The KSail site is how I would invisage a website for adult sailing courses would look if I was asked to design and develop one.

KSail is developed, based on real discussions and observations.
While the information on the site is not real, the methodology of providing a business case, personas and user stories is real life.

The link to the live KSail website is here: [KSail](https://doyle-kfd.github.io/KSail/)

## Design

### Overall comments
The current Adult Sailing web presence does not give the site visitors a "WOW" feeling. The textual content is clear and informative but is not supported by a user experience which will encourage the site visitor to make a decision to sign up or pay.

### Imagery
The imagery used in the KSail is selected to give the visitor a comfort feeling that they have arrived in the right place. It features sailboats similar to those that they will train on with imagery of people from the age demographic that KSail is targeting.

### Colours
THe colors are those of the RSGYC, Royal St. George Yacht Club. I have used the Blue as much as possible and gone as light on the red as possible.

### Fonts
The fonts used are from Google's library
- For Headings [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
- For Text [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)

## Features and benefits

### Navigation

### Footer
- The footer is visible on each page and has links to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp and a phone number. These links have been selected based on customer feedback. The idea of having a phone number and a WhatsApp icon on the footer is to allow the site visitor contact the sales team directly from the phone.
- The drop shadow on the footer is in reverse of the header one. It give the aesthetically pleasing effect of a 3D experience.

### About

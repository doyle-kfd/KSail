# KSail - Adult sailing courses

KSail is a microsite focused on adult sailing courses.
It is broadly designed around an exisiting page on the Royal St. George Yacht Club.
The KSail site is how I would invisage a website for adult sailing courses would look if I was asked to design and develop one.

KSail is developed, based on real discussions and observations.
While the information on the site is not real, the methodology of providing a business case, personas and user stories is real life.

## Design

### Overall comments
The current Adult Sailing web presence does not give the site visitors a "WOW" feeling. The textual content is clear and informative but is not supported by a user experience which will encourage the site visitor to make a decision to sign up or pay.

### Imagery
The imagery used in the KSail is selected to give the visitor a comfort feeling that they have arrived in the right place. It features sailboats similar to those that they will train on with imagery of people from the age demographic that KSail is targeting.

### Colours
THe colors are those of the RSGYC, Royal St. George Yacht Club. I have used the Blue as much as possible and gone as light on the red as possible.

### Fonts
The fonts used are from Google's library
- For Headings [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
- For Text [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)

## Features and benefits

### Navigation
- The responsive navigation bar links the logo, Home, About, Gallery and Contact pages.
- Th Nav bar is fixed in position, allowing navigation while scrolling
- Aesthetically, there is a drop shadow which gives a 3D effect.
![Navigation Bar](docs/readme_images/menu-bar.png)

### Footer
- The footer is visible on each page and has links to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp and a phone number. These links have been selected based on customer feedback. The idea of having a phone number and a WhatsApp icon on the footer is to allow the site visitor contact the sales team directly from the phone.
- The drop shadow on the footer is in reverse of the header one. It give the aesthetically pleasing effect of a 3D experience.
- The social icons open in a new tab to ensure the visitor stays on the KSail site.
- The two direct call to action buttons, WhatsApp and phone icons will start a direct action with the KSail team.

### About

- #### Note:
    - I consider the About page as a necessity but was not initially included as MVP.
    - The page lends credibility to our courses by showing that we have offerings that would suit someone who is looking for more than a weekend of sailing.

- #### About Hero Section
    - The hero image and the supporting text is used to show that behind KSail there is a club and the clubs motto.
    - The motto "No Boat No Problem" is used to give the site visitor the message that you dont need to own your own boat to sail.
    - The club is always looking for suitable members and KSail is an opportunity to offer trainees the opportunity to sample club life.
![About Page Hero section](docs/readme_images/ksail-about-hero.png)

- #### Welcome to the club section
    - The welcome section displays the club sailor offering. 
    - The 5 sections detail what the club has to offer with a color overlay on a background image to give textual contrast.
![About Page Welcome section](docs/readme_images/welcome-to-the-club.png)

- #### Clubs within the club section
    - This section details the depth within the sialing club. There are numerous options available if you are a member.
    - The imagery used in this section is all selected to imply quality.
    - The use of the age differences in the snooker image are chosen to show the age differences that members cover.
    - The title in each section has been given an opaque background and a drop shadow to make the text stand out.
![About Page Clubs section](docs/readme_images/clubs-within-the-club.png)

### Gallery

    - The gallery is based on a responsive mosaic style.
    - The images used are based on the target demographic from our personas and show the type of sailing boats the visitor can expect to use.

- #### Mosaic Gallery
    - The gallery has been designed using flexbox.
    - The gallery grows as the device breakpoints are engaged.

    - The contact form has been given its own page
    - The contact page gives all the details necessary to make an enquiry or visit or phone

- #### Contact Form
    - The contact form is overlaying a background image.
    - The form has an opqaue background to give the text contrast.
    - The contact form also has the postal address if the site visitor would like to do more research or visit.
    - The form allows the user make a selection based on the course they would like to discuss.
    - The course option on the form is used to help the club sales team understand the context of the enquiry.

    - The map on the page allows the site visitor see where the course is held.

## Given the time, I would implement

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.com
2. Select 'Settings' near the top of the page.
3. Select 'Pages' from the menu bar on the left of the page.
4. Under 'Source' select the 'Branch' dropdown menu and select the main branch.
5. Once selected, click the 'Save'.
6. Deployment should be confirmed by a message on a green background saying "Your site is published at" followed by the web address.

### Steps taken to increase score

The biggest factor in increasing the score was related to LCP (Largest Content Paintful)[LCP](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp)

The hero image on the page was delaying rendering.

#### Steps
- Resize hero image
- Moved loading of hero image from css to index.html
- added preload command to html

```
    <link rel="preload" fetchpriority="high" as="image" href="assets/images/hero-image-learn-to-sail.webp" type="image/webp">

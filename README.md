# KSail - Adult sailing courses

KSail is a microsite focused on adult sailing courses.
It is broadly designed around an exisiting page on the Royal St. George Yacht Club.
The KSail site is how I would invisage a website for adult sailing courses would look if I was asked to design and develop one.

KSail is developed, based on real discussions and observations.
While the information on the site is not real, the methodology of providing a business case, personas and user stories is real life.
